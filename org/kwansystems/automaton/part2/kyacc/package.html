<html><head><title>contextfree</title></head><body><p>Classes for describing and manipulating context-free grammars. This package is used to specify context-free grammars andtheir semantic actions, generate LR parse tables, and given a suitable input stream, parse that stream and run the semanticactions as appropriate. Note that even though nothing in Kyacc directly uses the PDA class, it is still a Part II machineand as such belongs as a subpackage of part2</p></body></html>
