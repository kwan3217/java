<!-- an explicit  Runge-Kutta method is defined by three tables
     often presented together in the so-called Butcher array

     the first table contains the time stepsof the s stages:
          c1, c2, ..., cs
     (c1 is always zero)

     the second table contains the weights of the stages:
          a21
          a31, a32
          ...
          as1, ... ass-1
     (this array is strictly lower triangular for explicit methods,
      so the first row is always empty)

     the third table contains the weights used to combine the
     internal stages and compute the state at the end of the step:
          b1, ..., bs

     embedded methods also have a fourth table which is used to
     hold another set of estimations weights, this additional set
     is used to estimate the error (and control the integration step)
     we do not hold these weights but rather the difference between
     these weights and the estimation weights bi:
          e1, ..., es
